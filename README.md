# WeatherWear

weatherwear.tech

ðŸŒž beep beep beep beep beepâ€¦ You hit your alarm, open the weather appâ€¦ 56 degrees. 
You roll out of bed, feeling disoriented, and head over to your closet, just as confused as to what clothes are appropriate for the weather today. 
We designed WeatherWear to streamline your morning routine. 
Gone are the days of deciphering what you should wear in 56-degree weather and running out of the house 15 minutes later than you wanted to. 
Gone are the days of dressing for the chilly morning and dripping sweat by 2pm. 
WeatherWear will help you decide what clothes you want to wear, anywhere.

This is a hackathon project built in 24 hours at Athena Hacks 2022 at the University of Southern California.
Implemented using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Firebase Realtime Database, and Open Weather API.
